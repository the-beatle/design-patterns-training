## Composition Vs Inheritance in Javascript

The problem with OOP is they've got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a 
banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle. John Armstrong. Creator of Erlang.


with inheritance describe what objects are an how they are related to each others, but
with composition you describe what an object can do through. 

With this way of programming you can create a set of actions that the monster can use,
withou inheritance or classes, it's very flexible and easy for programming.
